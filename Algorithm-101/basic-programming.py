# Input: Receiving data from various sources, which can include user input, data from files, databases, 
# or network connections. This data is then used as the starting point for computations or operations.

# Sample of user input
user_input = input("Enter something: ")

# Sample of file input
with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
    file_content = file.read()



# Processing: The core of any program where the actual work is done. This involves executing algorithms, 
# performing calculations, manipulating data, and applying logic as defined by the program's code.

# Example of data processing
def process_data(data):
    return data.upper()

processed_data = process_data(user_input)


# Output: Producing results based on the processed data. This could involve displaying information to the user, 
# writing data to files, sending data to other systems, or generating reports.


# Sample of output to console
print("Processed data:", processed_data)

# Sample of writing output to a file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(processed_data)
